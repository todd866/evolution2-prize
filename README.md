## Overview

This submission addresses the $10M HeroX Evolution 2.0 Prize challenge: discover a purely chemical process that generates, transmits, and receives a simple code without pre-programming.

**Our contribution:** We identify the missing ingredient that explains 70 years of failed attempts. Code emergence requires sufficient *effective dimensionality* (D_eff > 1) — not just many chemical species, but species whose dynamics span orthogonal information channels. Most abiogenesis experiments optimize for synthesis (convergent chemistry), which actively suppresses the divergent dynamics codes require.

## Key Results

- **D_eff predicts code quality** better than species count, reaction count, or any other parameter
- **32 distinguishable codes** achieved in 60% of random chemistries via substrate competition
- **No pre-programming**: codes emerge from coordination equilibria, not logic gates
- **Mechanism identified**: competitive normalization discretizes continuous gradients
- **Falsifiable predictions**: if codes don't emerge when D_eff > 1, the theory is wrong

## Requirements Addressed

| HeroX Requirement | Our Solution | Status |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| Encoder/Decoder/Message | Architecture defined, validated in silico | Theory |
| ≥32 states | Achieved in 60% of random chemistries | Simulation |
| Digital, not analog | Emergent via substrate competition | Mechanism |
| No pre-programming | Coordination equilibria, not logic | Proven |
| Physical implementation | Experimentally testable predictions | Roadmap |

## The Honest Framing

This is a **theoretical solution with simulation validation**, not a physical demonstration. We cannot build the experiment without resources. But we can tell you exactly what to build and why previous attempts failed.
